# Skeleton
Updated version of the prev skeleton with some of the names updated. 

When opening the zip make sure that you open the skeleton through the (skeleton.sln) or else you will have some problems later on, anyway the name of the file correspondence with what ur doing so if u dont remember look back and double check.

Of course thanks to Tyler for starting up the skeleton allowed me to understand somethings i didn't before.

For the ERD-PR file. To change/see it, click on the file, choose RAW and right click on the newly opened page, save the file to your desktop (make sure it has .drawio extension), open draw.io and drag your file there.
