# Skeleton
Updated version of the prev skeleton with some of the names updated. 

When opening the zip make sure that you open the skeleton through the (skeleton.sln) or else you will have some problems down the line
as usual, name of the file correspondence with what ur doing so if u dont remember look back and double check.

Of course thanks to Tyler for starting up the skeleton allowed me to understand somethings i didn't before.
